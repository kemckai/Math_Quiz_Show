## Which Should You Choose?

**For 2-week TSI prep, I recommend:**

1. **Jeopardy-Style (already built)** ✅ - Best all-around option
2. **Flashcard Mode** - Add for quick formula memorization
3. **Adaptive Practice Mode** - Most efficient use of limited time

You could also combine multiple formats! The Jeopardy game is a great foundation - we could easily add flashcard mode or adaptive practice as additional features.

Would you like me to:
- Enhance the current Jeopardy game with more questions?
- Build one of the other game modes?
- Add features to the existing game?
